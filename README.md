# Emotion-Analyzer

•	In this project, I have developed an Android Application that helps detect the current mood or emotion of a person based on the speech as an input.\
•	I have used the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer at the base and understood the underlying algorithm that predicts the emotion based on written texts.\
•	I have integrated it with the speech recognition module in Android to identify emotion from speech.


### IBM Watson Tone Analyzer

The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional and language tones in written text. 
You submit JSON, plain text, or HTML input that contains your written content to the service. The service accepts up to 128 KB of text, which is about 1000 sentences. The service returns JSON results that report the tone of your input. You can use these results to improve the perception and effectiveness of your communications, ensuring that your writing conveys the tone and style that you want for your intended audience.
